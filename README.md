* Architectural Diagram (Shows how key parts of the system work)>

<TODO:  Instructions for running the Python project.  How could a user with no context run this project without asking you for any help.  Include screenshots with explicit steps to create that work. Be sure to at least include the following screenshots:

### Instructions for running the Python project.

* Clone the project repo to Azure Cloud Shell
> git clone http://github.com/JehyeonHeo/building-CICD-pipeline-with-azure.git

* Checkout 'CI-learning' branch to experience continuous integration using Github Actions.
> git checkout CI-learning

* Passing tests that are displayed after running the `make all` command from the `Makefile`

* Output of a test run

* Successful deploy of the project in Azure Pipelines.  [Note the official documentation should be referred to and double checked as you setup CI/CD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/python-webapp?view=azure-devops).

* Project running on Azure App Service

* Running Azure App Service from Azure Pipelines automatic deployment

* Successful prediction from deployed flask app in Azure Cloud Shell.

* Output of streamed log files from deployed application
